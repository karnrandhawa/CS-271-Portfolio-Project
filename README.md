Implement and test two macros for string processing.

Implement and test two procedures for signed integers which use string primitive instructions. 

Invoke the mGetString macro to get user input in the form of a string of digits. Convert (using string primitives) the string of ascii digits to its numeric value representation (SDWORD), validating the userâ€™s input is a valid number (no letters, symbols, etc). Store this one value in a memory variable (output parameter, by reference). 

Convert a numeric SDWORD value (input parameter, by value) to a string of ASCII digits. Invoke macro to print the ASCII representation of the SDWORD value to the output.

Program takes 10 signed integers from a user (small enough to fit in a 32-bit register), validates the input, prints the input, and prints the sum and truncated average.
